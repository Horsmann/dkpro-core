The IMS Open Corpus Workbench is a linguistic search engine. It uses a tab-separated format
with limited markup (e.g. for sentences, documents, but not recursive structures like
parse-trees). If a local installation of the corpus workbench is available, it can be used
by this module to immediately generate the corpus workbench index format. Search is not
supported by this module.
