This project was initiated by the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab (UKP) at the Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany under the auspices of Prof. Iryna Gurevych.

## What are DKPro and DKPro Core?

*DKPro Core* addresses tasks that are commonly referred to as *linguistic pre-processing*, e.g. part-of-speech taggers, parsers, etc. Within DKPro Core, a steadily growing set of third-party tools for such tasks have been wrapped into interoperable and interchangeable components for the Apache UIMA framework.

*DKPro* was created as the *Darmstadt Knowledge Processing Repository* and first presented at the GSCL 2007. As part of becoming a community project, it was decided to drop the old long name. Presently, we continue to use *DKPro* as a neutral brand without any long form.

It is not uncommon for people to use *DKPro* and *DKPro Core* synonymously. However, they are not the
same. *DKPro* is a community that incorporates multiple projects and *DKPro Core* is but one of these
projects. Also, no all projects in the DKPro community are based on UIMA, but DKPro Core is.

## Who is developing DKPro Core?

For a long time, DKPro Core has been exclusively developed by the members of the UKP Lab. Later, members of the Language Technology Lab, Universität Duisburg-Essen joined in. Since 2014, DKPro opened up to become a community project and has adopted a contributor license agreement approach to contributions.

**We would like to thank [all those who contribute or have contributed](http://github.com/dkpro/dkpro-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.txt) to DKPro Core!**
