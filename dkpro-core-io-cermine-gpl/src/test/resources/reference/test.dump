  10.1162/COLI Argumentation Mining in User-Generated Web Discourse Ivan Habernal habernal@ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de 0 1 Research 0 1 Technische Universita¨t 0 1 0 German Institute for Educational 1 Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab (UKP-DIPF), German Institute for Educational Research Schloßstraße 29, D-60486 Frankfurt am Main Germany and  Technische Universita ̈t Darmstadt, Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab, TU Darmstadt - FB 20a Hochschulstrasse 10 D-64289 Darmstadt Germany 43 1 138 179 2 4 2015 The goal of argumentation mining, an evolving research field in computational linguistics, is to design methods capable of analyzing people's argumentation. In this article, we go beyond the state of the art in several ways. (i) We deal with actual Web data and take up the challenges given by the variety of registers, multiple domains, and unrestricted noisy user-generated Web discourse. (ii) We bridge the gap between normative argumentation theories and argumentation phenomena encountered in actual data by adapting an argumentation model tested in an extensive annotation study. (iii) We create a new gold standard corpus (90k tokens in 340 documents) and experiment with several machine learning methods to identify argument components. We offer the data, source codes, and annotation guidelines to the community under free licenses. Our findings show that argumentation mining in user-generated Web discourse is a feasible but challenging task. 1. Introduction
 (Aristotle and Kennedy [translator] 1991) Mercier and Sperber (2011) (Micheli
2011) (van Eemeren, Grootendorst,
and Snoeck Henkemans 2002) (Green et al. 2014) Our motivation for argumentation mining stems from a practical information
seeking perspective from the user-generated content on the Web. For example, when
users search for information in user-generated Web content to facilitate their personal
decision-making related to controversial topics, they lack tools to overcome the current
information overload. One particular use-case example dealing with a forum post
discussing private versus public schools is shown in Figure 1. Here, the lengthy text
on the left-hand side is transformed into an argument gist on the right-hand side by
(i) analyzing argument components and (ii) summarizing their content. Figure 2 shows
another use-case example, in which users search for reasons that underpin certain
standpoints in a given controversy (which is homeschooling in this case). In general, the
output of automatic argument analysis performed on the large scale in Web data can
provide users with analyzed arguments to a given topic of interest, find the evidence for
the given controversial standpoint, or help to reveal flaws in argumentation of others. (Wachsmuth et al. 2014) (Llewellyn et al. 2014) (Stab and Gurevych 2014a) (Park and Cardie 2014) (Goudas et al. 2014) Teufel and Moens
(2002) Original text
 The public schooling system is not as bad as some may
think. Some mentioned that those who are educated in the
public schools are less educated, well I actually think it
would be in the reverse. Student who study in the private
sector actually pay a fair amount of fees to do so and I
believe that the students actually get let off for a lot more
than anyone would in a public school. And its all because
of the money. In a private school, a student being expelled
or suspended is not just one student out the door, its the
rest of that students schooling life fees gone. Whereas in a
public school, its just the student gone. I have always gone
to public schools and when I finished I got into University. I
do not feel disadvantaged at all. Extracted argument gist
 I claim that public schools are good
because students in private schools are only
source of money. I can back-up my
argument: I have always gone to public
schools and when I finished I got into
University. I do not feel disadvantaged at
all. On the other hand some mentioned
that those who are educated in the public
schools are less educated. Reasons for homeschooling
 Schools provide a totally unstimulating
environment. Lesson plans (and the national curriculum)
are the death of real education. Evidence including our own suggests
strongly that this kind of education prepares
children to enter further and higher education,
or the workforce - and offers them the freedom
to learn in the ways that suit them best. We teach our children how to learn, not
merely how to pass tests. Reasons against homeschooling
 Keeping your kids away from knowledge
that you don’t like is a moral crime. Religious zealotry is no excuse for raising a
kid devoid of a proper education. (Feng and Hirst 2011; Mochales and Moens 2011;
Walton 2012; Villalba and Saint-Dizier 2012; Florou et al. 2013) (Park and
Cardie 2014, page 29) (van Eemeren et al. 2014, page 11) These challenges can be formulated into the following research questions:
r
r
r
r
r Can we adapt models from argumentation theories that have been usually
lacking empirical evidence on large real-world corpora for modeling
argumentation in user-generated Web content?
What are the desired properties of the argumentation model and is there a
trade-off between model complexity and annotation reliability?
What phenomena are typical of argumentation on the Web, how should
we approach their modeling, and what challenges do they pose?
What is the impact of different controversial topics and are there
differences in argumentation between various registers?
What computational approaches can be used to analyze arguments on the
Web? In this article, we push the boundaries of the argumentation mining field by
focusing on several novel aspects. We tackle these research questions as well as the previously
discussed challenges and issues. First, we target user-generated Web discourse from
several domains across various registers to examine how argumentation is
communicated in different contexts. Second, we bridge the gap between argumentation theories
and argumentation mining by selecting the argumentation model based on research
into argumentation theories and related fields in communication studies or psychology.
In particular, we adapt normative models from argumentation theory to perform
empirical research in NLP and support our application of argumentation theories with an
in-depth reliability study. Finally, we use state-of-the-art NLP techniques in order to
build robust computational models for analyzing arguments that are capable of dealing
with a variety of genres on the Web.4 1.1 Our Contributions
 We create a new corpus which is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest corpus that
has been annotated within the argumentation mining field to date. We choose several
target domains from educational controversies, such as homeschooling, single-sex
education, and mainstreaming.5 A novel aspect of the corpus is its coverage of different registers
of user-generated Web content, such as comments on articles, discussion forum posts,
blog posts, as well as professional newswire articles. (Habernal and
Gurevych 2015) Habernal and Gurevych (2015) From the computational perspective, we experiment on the annotated data using
various machine learning methods in order to extract argument structure from
documents. We propose several novel feature sets and identify configurations that run
best in in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. To foster research in the community, we
provide the annotated data as well as all the experimental software under free license.6 The rest of the article is structured as follows. First, we provide an essential
background in argumentation theory in Section 2. Section 3 surveys related work in
several areas. Then we introduce the data set and two annotation studies in Section 4.
Section 5 presents our experimental work and discusses the results and errors, and
Section 6 concludes this article. 2. Theoretical Background
 MacEwan
(1898) (Freeley and Steinberg 2008; Damer 2013) (Ketcham 1917; Mercier and Sperber 2011; Nettel and
Roque 2011) (O’Keefe 2002, page 5) ough, as O’Keefe (2011 (Blair 2011) (Schiappa and Nordin 2013, page 6) Toulmin (1958) (Amossy 2009) One fundamental problem with the definition and formal description of arguments
and argumentation is that there is no agreement even among argumentation theorists.
As van Eemeren et al. (2014, page 29) admit in their very recent and exhaustive survey of
the field, ”as yet, there is no unitary theory of argumentation that encompasses the
logical, dialectical, and rhetorical dimensions of argumentation and is universally accepted.
The current state of the art in argumentation theory is characterized by the coexistence
of a variety of theoretical perspectives and approaches, which differ considerably from
each other in conceptualization, scope, and theoretical refinement.” 2.1 Argumentation Models

 Toulmin (1958) (Toulmin, Rieke, and
Janik 1984, page 29) (Freeley and Steinberg 2008, page 153) (Schiappa
and Nordin 2013) (Toulmin 2003, page 90) Warrant The role of warrant is to justify a logical inference from the grounds to the claim.
Backing is a set of information that stands behind the warrant. It assures its
trustworthiness. Qualifier limits the degree of certainty under which the argument should be accepted. (Toulmin 2003, page 93) Rebuttal presents a situation in which the claim might be defeated. A schema of Toulmin’s original model is shown in Figure 3. The lines and arrows
symbolize implicit relations between the components. An example of an argument
rendered using Toulmin’s scheme can be seen in Figure 4. We believe that this theoretical overview should provide sufficient background for
the argumentation mining research covered in this article; for further references, we
recommend, for example, van Eemeren et al. (2014). 3. Related Work in Computational Linguistics

 (Teufel, Carletta, and
Moens 1999) Reed and Rowe (2004) (Feng and Hirst 2011) Biran and Rambow (2011) (Walton 2007) Stab and Gurevych (2014a) annotated 90 argumentative essays (about 30k tokens),
annotating claims, major claims, and premises and their relations (support, attack). They
reached Krippendorff’s U = 0:72 for argument components and Krippendorff’s =
0:81 for relations between components. Rosenthal and McKeown (2012) annotated sentences that are opinionated claims,
in which the author expresses a belief that should be adopted by others. Two
annotators labeled sentences as claims without any context and achieved Cohen’s = 0:50
(2,000 sentences from LiveJournal) and 0.56 (2,000 sentences from Wikipedia). Aharoni et al. (2014) (Ferschke 2014) Wacholder et al. (2014) Ghosh et al. (2014) Park and Cardie (2014) annotated about 10k sentences from 1,047 documents into
four types of argument propositions with Cohen’s = 0:73 on 30% of the data set. Only
7% of the sentences were found to be non-argumentative. Faulkner (2014) Goudas et al. (2014) Kluge (2014 Houy

for classifying whether a sentence belongs to an argumentative element or not, using
the same corpus. (Stab and Gurevych
2014a) Biran and Rambow (2011) Llewellyn et al. (2014) Park and Cardie (2014) classified propositions into three classes
(unverifiable, verifiable non-experimental, and verifiable experimental) and ignored
nonargumentative texts. Using multi-class support vector machine (SVM) and a wide
range of features (n-grams, POS, sentiment clue words, tense, person) they achieved
MacroF1 = 0:69. Peldszus (2014) experimented with a rather complex labeling schema of
argument segments, but the data were artificially created for the task and manually cleaned
(such as removing segments that did not meet the criteria or non-argumentative
segments). Goudas et al. (2014) Saint-Dizier (2012) developed a Prolog engine using a lexicon of 1,300 words and a
set of 78 hand-crafted rules with the focus on a particular argument structure, “reasons
supporting conclusions,” in French. Cabrio and Villata (2012) Dung (1995) (Dagan et al. 2009) (Mann
and Thompson 1987) (Prasad et al. 2008) 3.2 Stance Detection
 Research related to argumentation mining also involves stance detection. In this case,
the whole document (discussion post, article) is assumed to represent the writer’s
standpoint on the discussed topic. Because the topic is stated as a controversial question,
the author is either for or against it. (Prasad et al. 2008) Hasan and Ng (2013) Gottipati et al. (2013) Hasan and Ng (2012) Qiu and Jiang (2013) oot,
Bird, and Baldwin (2011 ong
(2011 Walker et al. (2012) 3.3 Online Persuasion
 Another stream of research has been devoted to persuasion in online media, which we
consider as a more general research topic than argumentation. Mohammadi et al. (2013) Murphy (2001) Le (2004) Wang (2013) Georgila et al. (2011) Lippi and Torroni
(2016) (Cardie 2015) 4. Annotation Studies and Corpus Creation
 (van Eemeren
et al. 2014) (Bentahar, Moulin, and Be´langer 2010) (Prasad et al. 2008) A motivation for creating a new corpus stems from the various use-cases discussed
in the introduction, as well as some research gaps pointed out in Section 1 and further
discussed in the survey in Section 3.1 (e.g., domain restrictions, missing connection to
argumentation theories, non-reported reliability or detailed schemes). 4.1 Topics and Registers
 (Huang and Invernizzi 2013) Because we were also interested in whether argumentation differs across registers,10
we included four different registers, namely, (1) user comments to newswire articles
or to blog posts; (2) posts in discussion forums (forum posts); (3) blog posts; and
(4) newswire articles.11 Throughout this work, we will refer to each article, blog post,
comment, or forum posts as a document. This variety of sources covers mainly
usergenerated content except newswire articles, which are written by professionals and
undergo an editing procedure by the publisher. Because many publishers also host
blog-like sections on their portals, we consider as blog posts all content that is hosted
on personal blogs or clearly belong to a blog category within a newswire portal. 4.2 Raw Corpus Statistics
 Given the six controversial topics and four different registers, we compiled a collection
of plain-text documents, which we call the raw corpus. It contains 694,110 tokens in
5,444 documents. As a coarse-grained analysis of the data, we examined the lengths and
the number of paragraphs (see Figure 5). Comments and forum posts follow a similar
distribution, being shorter than 300 tokens on average. By contrast, articles and blogs are
longer than 400 tokens and have 9.2 paragraphs on average. The process of compiling
the raw corpus and its further statistics are described in detail in Appendix A. 4.3 Annotation Study 1: Identifying Persuasive Documents in Forums and Comments
 (Biber and Conrad 2009, page 6) Document length frequency
artcomment
article (Garcia-Villalba and Saint-Dizier 2014; Park and Cardie 2014) In order to filter documents that are suitable for argumentation annotation, we
defined a binary document-level classification task. The distinction is made between
either persuasive documents or non-persuasive (which includes all other sorts of
texts, such as off-topic, story sharing, unrelated dialog acts, etc.).
4.3.1 Annotation Study. The two annotated categories were on-topic persuasive and
nonpersuasive.12 Three annotators with near-native English proficiency annotated a set of
990 documents (a random subset of comments and forum posts) reaching a Fleiss’
of 0.59. The final label was selected by majority voting. The annotation study took
an average of 15 hours per annotator, with approximately 55 annotated documents
per hour. The resulting labels were derived by majority voting. Out of 990 documents,
524 (53%) were labeled as on-topic persuasive. We will refer to this corpus as gold data
persuasive. Nicholson and Leask (2012) Guadagno and Cialdini (2002) 4.4 Annotation Study 2: Annotating Micro-structure of Arguments
 Landis and Koch (1977 Artstein and Poesio (2008) Trabelsi and Zaiane (2014) (Toulmin 1958) (Walton,
Reed, and Macagno 2008) Walton (2005) Walton (2012) (Prasad et al.
2008) Macagno and Konstantinidou (2012) Anthony and Kim (2014) (Anthony and Kim 2014, page 93) Ball (1994) Freeman (1991) (Simosi 2003; Dunn 2011) Chambliss (1995) Voss (2006) Stegmann et al. (2011) Garcia-Mila et al. (2013) Weinberger and Fischer (2006) In order to prove the suitability of Toulmin’s model, we analyzed 40 random
documents from the gold data persuasive data set using the original Toulmin model as
presented in Section 2.3.15 We took into account several criteria for assessment, such
as frequency of occurrence of the components or their importance for the task. We
proposed some modifications of the model based on the following observations.
No Qualifier. Authors do not state the degree of cogency (the probability of their claim, as
proposed by Toulmin). Thus we omitted qualifier from the model because of its absence
in the data. Voss
(2006) (Walton 2007, page 106) Kluge (2014 (Reed and Rowe 2006; van Eemeren et al. 2014) (Mochales and Moens 2011; Peldszus and Stede 2013b; Ghosh et al. 2014; Stab and
Gurevych 2014a) (Freeman 1991; Newman and
Marshall 1991; Hitchcock 2003) The annotators were instructed to distinguish between premises and backing, so
that premises should cover generally applicable reasons for the claim, whereas backing
is a single personal experience or statements that give credibility or attribute certain
expertise to the author. As a sanity check, the argument should still make sense after
removing backing (would only be considered “weaker”).
4.4.3 Model Definition. We call the model a modified Toulmin model. It contains five
argument components, namely, claim, premise, backing, rebuttal, and refutation. When
annotating a document, any arbitrary token span can be labeled with an argument
component; the components do not overlap. The spans are not known in advance and
the annotator thus chooses the span and the component type at the same time. All
components are optional (they do not have to be present in the argument) except the
claim, which is either explicit or implicit (see above). If a token span is not labeled by
any argument component, it is not considered as a part of the argument and is later
denoted as none (this category is not assigned by the annotators). An example analysis of a forum post is shown in Figure 6. Figure 7 then shows a
diagram of the analysis from that example (the content of the argument components
was shortened or rephrased).
4.4.4 Annotation Workflow. The annotation experiment was split into three phases. All
documents were annotated by three independent annotators, who participated in two
training sessions. During the first phase, 50 random comments and forum posts were
annotated. Problematic cases were resolved after discussion and the guidelines were Doc#4733 (forumpost, public-private-schools) [claim: The public schooling system is
 not as bad as some may think.] [:re:b:u:t:ta:l:::S:o:m:e::m:e:n:t:io:n:e:d::th:a:t:t:h:o:s:e:w:h:o::a:re::e:d:u:c:a:te:d:

refined. In the second phase, we wanted to extend the range of annotated registers, so
we selected 148 comments and forum posts as well as 41 blog posts. After the second
phase, the annotation guidelines were final.16 In the final phase, we extended the range of annotated registers and added
newswire articles from the raw corpus in order to test whether the annotation
guidelines (and inherently the model) was general enough. Therefore we selected 96
comments/forum posts, 8 blog posts, and 8 articles for this phase. A detailed inter-annotator
agreement study on documents from this final phase is reported in Section 4.4.6. The annotations were very time-consuming. In total, each annotator spent 35 hours
annotating over the course of five weeks. Discussions and consolidation of the gold data
took another 6 hours. Comments and forum posts required an average of 4 minutes
per document to annotate, whereas blog posts and articles required an average of
14 minutes per document. Examples of annotated documents from the gold data are
listed in Appendix A.

single token does not convey enough information that could be encoded as features
for a machine learner. However, as discussed in Section 4.4.5, the annotations were
performed on data pre-segmented to sentences and annotating tokens was necessary
only when the sentence segmentation was wrong or one sentence contained
multiple argument components. Our corpus consists of 3,899 sentences, from which 2,214
sentences (57%) contain no argument components. From the remaining ones, only 50
sentences (1%) have more than one argument component. Although in 19 cases (0.5%)
the sentence contains a Claim–Premise pair, which is an important distinction from the
argumentation perspective, given the overall small number of such occurrences, we
simplify the task by treating each sentence as if it has either one argument component
or none. The approximation with sentence-level units is explained in the example in Figure 8.
In order to evaluate the expected performance loss using this approximation, we used
an oracle that always predicts the correct label for the unit (sentence) and evaluated
it against the true labels (recall that the evaluation against the true gold labels is done
always on token level). We lose only about 10% of Macro-F1 score (0.906) and only about
2% of accuracy (0.984). This performance is still acceptable, while allowing us to model
sequences where the minimal unit is a sentence.
5.1.2 Gold Data Statistics. Table 8 shows the distribution of the classes in the gold data
Toulmin, where the labeling was already mapped to the sentences. The minimal presence
of rebuttal and refutation (four classes account for only 3.4% of the data) makes this data
set very unbalanced. S1

 (Joachims, Finley, and Yu 2009) We defined the following feature sets:
r
r
r
–
–
–
–
– FS0: Baseline lexical features
 word uni-, bi-, and tri-grams (binary) FS1: Structural, morphological, and syntactic features
 First and last three tokens. Motivation: these tokens may contain
discourse markers or other indicators for argument components,
such as therefore and since for premises or think and believe for
claims. Relative position in paragraph and relative position in document.
Motivation: We expect that claims are more likely to appear at the
beginning or at the end of the document. Number of POS 1-3 grams, dependency tree depth, constituency
tree production rules, and number of subclauses. Based on Stab
and Gurevych (2014b). FS2: Topic and sentiment features
 (McCallum 2002;
Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003) (Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira 2001) Keerthi and Sundararajan (2007) Scores for five sentiment categories (from very negative to very
positive) obtained from the Stanford sentiment analyzer (Socher et
al. 2013). Motivation: Claims usually express opinions and carry
sentiment. FS3: Semantic, coreference, and discourse features
 (Choi 2012) Namely, we extract agent, predicate + agent, predicate + agent + patient
+ (optional) negation, argument type + argument value, and discourse
marker, which are based on PropBank semantic role labels.34
Motivation: Exploit the semantics of capturing the semantics of the
sentences. (Lee
et al. 2013) (Lin, Ng, and Kan 2014) (Cabrio, Tonelli, and Villata 2013) (Mikolov
et al. 2013) (Socher et al. 2013; Guo et al. 2014) Except for the baseline lexical features, all feature types are extracted not only for
the current sentence si, but also for C preceding and subsequent sentences, namely,
si C, si C+1, : : : si+C 1, si+C, where C was empirically set to 4.36 Each feature is then
represented with a prefix to determine its relative position to the current sequence
unit.37
5.1.4 Results. Let us first discuss the upper bounds of the system. Performance of the
three human annotators is shown in the first column of Table 9 (results are obtained
34 Explained in detail in annotation guidelines at Le and Mikolov (2014) In our experiments, the feature sets were combined in the bottom–up manner,
starting with the simple lexical features (FS0), adding structural and syntactic features
(FS1), then adding topic and sentiment features (FS2), then features reflecting the
discourse structure (FS3), and finally enriched with completely unsupervised latent vector
space representation (FS4). In addition, we were gradually removing the simple features
(without lexical features, without syntactic features, etc.) to test the system with more
“abstract” feature sets (feature ablation). The results are shown in Table 9. The overall best performance (Macro-F1 = 0.251) was achieved using the rich feature
sets (01234 and 234) and significantly outperformed the baseline as well as other feature
sets. Classification of non-argumentative text (the “O” class) yields an F1 score of
about 0.7 even in the baseline setting. The boundaries of claims (Cla-B), premises
(PreB), and backing, (Bac-B) reach on average lower scores than their respective inside tags
(Cla-I, Pre-I, Bac-I). It can be interpreted such that the system is able to classify that a
certain sentence belongs to a certain argument component, but the distinction whether
it is a beginning of the argument component is harder. The very low numbers for
rebuttal and refutation have two reasons. First, these two argument components caused
many disagreements in the annotations, as discussed in Section 4.4.8, and were hard to
recognize for the humans, too. Second, these four classes have very few instances in the
corpus (about 3.4%, see Table 8), so the classifier suffers from the lack of training data. The results for the in-domain cross validation scenario are shown in Table 10. Similarly
to the cross-validation scenario, the overall best results were achieved using the largest
feature set (01234). For mainstreaming and red-shirting, the best results were achieved
using only the feature set 4 (embeddings). These two domains also contain fewer
documents, compared with other domains (refer to Table 2). We suspect that
embeddingsbased features convey important information when not enough in-domain data are
available. This observation will become apparent in the next experiment. The cross-domain experiments yield rather poor results for most of the feature
combinations (Table 11). However, using only feature set 4 (embeddings), the system
performance increases rapidly, so it is even comparable to numbers achieved in the
in Feature set combinations
 (Le and Mikolov
2014) (Wang et
al. 2013) Backing-B is often confused with Premise-B (12%) and Backing-I with Premise-I (23%).
Similarly, Premise-I is misclassified as Backing-I in 9%. This shows that distinguishing
between backing and premises is not easy because these two components are similar
such that they support the claim, as discussed in Section 4.4.8. We can also see that the
misclassification is consistent among *-B and *-I tags. Rebuttal is often misclassified as Premise (28% for Rebuttal-I and 18% for Rebuttal-B;
notice again the consistency in *-B and *-I tags). This is rather surprising, as one would
expect that rebuttal would be confused with a claim, because its role is to provide an
opposing view. Refutation-B and Refutation-I is misclassified as Premise-I in 19% and 27% of the cases,
respectively. This finding confirms the discussion in section 4.4.8, because the role of
refutation is highly context-dependent. From a pragmatic perspective, it is put forward
to indirectly support the claim by attacking the rebuttal, thus having a similar function
to the premise.
5.1.6 Qualitative Error Analysis. We manually examined misclassified examples
produced by the best-performing system to identify which phenomena pose the biggest
challenges. Properly detecting boundaries of argument components caused problems,
as shown in Figure 9(a). This is in line with the granularity annotation difficulties
discussed in Section 4.4.8. The next example in Figure 9(b) shows that even if boundaries
of components were detected precisely, the distinction between premise and backing

fails. The example also shows that in some cases, labeling on clause level is required
(left-hand side claim and premise) but the approximation in the system cannot cope with
this level of detail (as explained in Section 5.1.1). Confusing non-argumentative text
and argument components by the system is sometimes plausible, as is the case of the
last rhetorical question in Figure 9(c). On the other hand, the last example in Figure 9(d)
shows that some claims using figurative language were difficult to identify. The
complete predictions along with the gold data are publicly available.38
Hyper-parameter Tuning. SVMhmm offers many hyper-parameters with suggested default
values, of which three are of importance. Parameter t sets the order of dependencies of
transitions in HMM, parameter e sets the order of dependencies of emissions in HMM,
and parameter c represents a trading-off slack versus magnitude of the weight-vector.39
For all experiments, we set all the hyper-parameters to their default values (t = 1, e = 0,
c = 5:0). Using the best performing feature set from Table 9, we experimented with a
grid search over different values (c 2 f0:1, 1:0, 5:0, 10:0, 50:0g, e 2 f0, 1g, t 2 f1, 2, 3g) but
the results did not outperform the system trained with default parameter values.
5.1.7 Discussion. The F1 scores might seem very low at first glance. One obvious reason
is the actual performance of the system, which gives plenty of room for improvement in
the future.40 But the main cause of low F1 numbers is the evaluation measure—using
11 classes on the token level is very strict, as it penalizes a mismatch in argument
component boundaries the same way as a wrongly predicted argument component
type. Therefore we also report two other evaluation metrics that help to put our results
into context. r
r Krippendorff’s U—This was also used for evaluating inter-annotator
agreement (see Section 4.4.6). (Fournier 2013) (Artstein and Poesio 2008) Vovk (2013) Fournier
(2013) The overall performance of the system is also affected by the accuracy of individual
NLP tools used for extracting features. One particular problem is that the preprocessing
models we rely on (POS, syntax, semantic roles, coreference, discourse; see Section 5.1.3)

together with the gold annotations in the logos dimension side by side in the
accompanying software package. We believe this will help the community to see the strengths of
our model as well as possible limitations of our current approaches. 6. Conclusions
 Let us begin with summarizing answers to the research questions stated in the
Introduction. First, as we showed in Section 4.4.2, existing argumentation theories do offer
models for capturing argumentation in user-generated content on the Web. We built
upon the Toulmin model and proposed some extensions. Second, as compared to the negative experiences with annotating using Walton’s
schemes (see Sections 4.4.1 and 3.1), our modified Toulmin model offers a trade-off
between its expressiveness and annotation reliability. However, we found that the
capabilities of the model to capture argumentation depend on the register and topic,
the length of the document, and inherently on the literary devices and structures
used for expressing argumentation as these properties influence the agreement among
annotators. Third, there are aspects of online argumentation that lack their established
theoretical counterparts, such as rhetorical questions, figurative language, narratives, and
fallacies in general. We tried to model some of them in the pathos dimension of
argument (Section 4.4.10), but no satisfying agreement was reached. Furthermore, we
dealt with a step that precedes argument analysis by filtering documents, given their
persuasiveness with respect to the controversy. Finally, we proposed a computational
model based on machine learning for identifying argument components (Section 5.1). In
this identification task, we experimented with a wide range of linguistically motivated
features and found that (1) the largest feature set (including n-grams, structural features,
syntactic features, topic distribution, sentiment distribution, semantic features,
coreference feaures, discourse features, and features based on word embeddings) performs
best both in in-domain and all-data cross validation, whereas (2) features based only on
word embeddings yield best results in cross-domain evaluation. Because there is no one-size-fits-all argumentation theory to be applied to actual
data on the Web, the argumentation model and an annotation scheme for argumentation
mining is a function of the task requirements and the corpus properties. Its selection
should be based on the data at hand and the desired application. Given the proposed
use-case scenarios (Section 1) and the results of our annotation study (Section 4.4),
we recommend a scheme based on the Toulmin model for short documents, such as
comments or forum posts. Summary of Contributions. In this article we presented our original research of
argumentation mining in the user-generated Web discourse by collecting data in six controversial
topics in education. We conducted an annotation study on 990 documents to filter
persuasive comments and forum posts with inter-annotator agreement of Fleiss’ = 0:59.
Then we annotated 340 documents (approx. 90k tokens) on the token level with a
modified Toulmin model and reached inter-annotator agreement of 0.48 (Krippendorff’s
joint U). We proposed a sequence labeling approach to identify argument components
in the discourse and significantly (p< 0:001) outperformed the baseline (0.156) with
overall Macro-F1 = 0.251. We also found that a feature set based on word embeddings
works well in a cross-domain scenario and reaches Macro-F1 = 0.209. We thoroughly
examined errors made by the system and proposed future improvements. As the argumentation mining field is still evolving, and to foster future research,
we provide our annotation guidelines, the annotated data, the source codes for the
experiments, as well as the results of our system for error analysis. We believe that
keeping the whole process transparent will help to identify the strengths and possible
shortcomings and will motivate the community to build upon our work. Appendix A. Raw Corpus Compilation
 Given the six controversial topics and four different registers introduced in Section
4.1, we compiled the raw corpus semi-automatically. Web sites with relevant comments
to articles and discussion forums were identified manually (Google search engine) in
order to maximize their relatedness to the search topic. We did not prefer any particular
platform or data source. We extracted the texts automatically, however, we did some
minimal data pre-selection and cleaning. If article comments formed a tree structure,
we kept only the root comments, as they most likely comment on the topic of the article,
according to our observations. In discussion forum posts, we automatically removed all
quotations (users usually quote the previous post to which they react). (McGee 2014) The top ten source domains from the total number of 117 unique domains are listed
in Table A.1. Table A.2 shows the document distribution with respect to the registers
and topics. Appendix B. Examples of Annotated Documents from the Second Annotation Study

Claim “Home schooling should be illegal” “I don’t see any need for home schooling
any child” Premise Science and technology are not taught in HS “In an increasingly
complex, global technological society, all people need to have a basic understanding of
science, technology and local and global culture, just to be able to function and make
informed decisions.” Public school in the US is bad “Public education in the US seems to
be a self-perpetuating disaster, with ignorant, uneducated, unqualified people on
school boards deciding what children should learn.” Rebuttal HS is ok if parents
demonstrate the same level of education as in schools “the parent can demonstrate that they
are providing the same level of education as a public school.” HS can be allowed for kids
with special needs “the child has special needs or learning difficulties.” Appeal to
emotion “Depriving your child of a basic education is a form of child abuse. It can
ruin your child’s whole life.” Example (B.2)
 This example contains annotations both in the logos and the pathos dimensions. The
main support for the authors’ implicit claim starts with “I personally am acquainted
with four families ...” Another reason is the social skills. Doc#163 (comment, homeschooling) Thank you for bringing this tragedy to light.

In this article, we go beyond the state of the art in several ways. (i) We deal with actual Web data and take up the challenges given by the variety of registers, multiple domains, and unrestricted noisy user-generated Web discourse. (ii) We bridge the gap between normative argumentation theories and argumentation phenomena encountered in actual data by adapting an argumentation model tested in an extensive annotation study. (iii) We create a new gold standard corpus (90k tokens in 340 documents) and experiment with several machine learning methods to identify argument components. We offer the data, source codes, and annotation guidelines to the community under free licenses. Our findings show that argumentation mining in user-generated Web discourse is a feasible but challenging task.]

[ Our motivation for argumentation mining stems from a practical information
seeking perspective from the user-generated content on the Web. For example, when
users search for information in user-generated Web content to facilitate their personal
decision-making related to controversial topics, they lack tools to overcome the current
information overload. One particular use-case example dealing with a forum post
discussing private versus public schools is shown in Figure 1. Here, the lengthy text
on the left-hand side is transformed into an argument gist on the right-hand side by
(i) analyzing argument components and (ii) summarizing their content. Figure 2 shows
another use-case example, in which users search for reasons that underpin certain
standpoints in a given controversy (which is homeschooling in this case). In general, the
output of automatic argument analysis performed on the large scale in Web data can
provide users with analyzed arguments to a given topic of interest, find the evidence for
the given controversial standpoint, or help to reveal flaws in argumentation of others.]

[ The public schooling system is not as bad as some may
think. Some mentioned that those who are educated in the
public schools are less educated, well I actually think it
would be in the reverse. Student who study in the private
sector actually pay a fair amount of fees to do so and I
believe that the students actually get let off for a lot more
than anyone would in a public school. And its all because
of the money. In a private school, a student being expelled
or suspended is not just one student out the door, its the
rest of that students schooling life fees gone. Whereas in a
public school, its just the student gone. I have always gone
to public schools and when I finished I got into University. I
do not feel disadvantaged at all.]

focusing on several novel aspects. We tackle these research questions as well as the previously
discussed challenges and issues. First, we target user-generated Web discourse from
several domains across various registers to examine how argumentation is
communicated in different contexts. Second, we bridge the gap between argumentation theories
and argumentation mining by selecting the argumentation model based on research
into argumentation theories and related fields in communication studies or psychology.
In particular, we adapt normative models from argumentation theory to perform
empirical research in NLP and support our application of argumentation theories with an
in-depth reliability study. Finally, we use state-of-the-art NLP techniques in order to
build robust computational models for analyzing arguments that are capable of dealing
with a variety of genres on the Web.4]

and argumentation is that there is no agreement even among argumentation theorists.
As van Eemeren et al. (2014, page 29) admit in their very recent and exhaustive survey of
the field, ”as yet, there is no unitary theory of argumentation that encompasses the
logical, dialectical, and rhetorical dimensions of argumentation and is universally accepted.
The current state of the art in argumentation theory is characterized by the coexistence
of a variety of theoretical perspectives and approaches, which differ considerably from
each other in conceptualization, scope, and theoretical refinement.”]

[ The annotators were instructed to distinguish between premises and backing, so
that premises should cover generally applicable reasons for the claim, whereas backing
is a single personal experience or statements that give credibility or attribute certain
expertise to the author. As a sanity check, the argument should still make sense after
removing backing (would only be considered “weaker”).
4.4.3 Model Definition. We call the model a modified Toulmin model. It contains five
argument components, namely, claim, premise, backing, rebuttal, and refutation. When
annotating a document, any arbitrary token span can be labeled with an argument
component; the components do not overlap. The spans are not known in advance and
the annotator thus chooses the span and the component type at the same time. All
components are optional (they do not have to be present in the argument) except the
claim, which is either explicit or implicit (see above). If a token span is not labeled by
any argument component, it is not considered as a part of the argument and is later
denoted as none (this category is not assigned by the annotators).]

single token does not convey enough information that could be encoded as features
for a machine learner. However, as discussed in Section 4.4.5, the annotations were
performed on data pre-segmented to sentences and annotating tokens was necessary
only when the sentence segmentation was wrong or one sentence contained
multiple argument components. Our corpus consists of 3,899 sentences, from which 2,214
sentences (57%) contain no argument components. From the remaining ones, only 50
sentences (1%) have more than one argument component. Although in 19 cases (0.5%)
the sentence contains a Claim–Premise pair, which is an important distinction from the
argumentation perspective, given the overall small number of such occurrences, we
simplify the task by treating each sentence as if it has either one argument component
or none.]

[ The approximation with sentence-level units is explained in the example in Figure 8.
In order to evaluate the expected performance loss using this approximation, we used
an oracle that always predicts the correct label for the unit (sentence) and evaluated
it against the true labels (recall that the evaluation against the true gold labels is done
always on token level). We lose only about 10% of Macro-F1 score (0.906) and only about
2% of accuracy (0.984). This performance is still acceptable, while allowing us to model
sequences where the minimal unit is a sentence.
5.1.2 Gold Data Statistics. Table 8 shows the distribution of the classes in the gold data
Toulmin, where the labeling was already mapped to the sentences. The minimal presence
of rebuttal and refutation (four classes account for only 3.4% of the data) makes this data
set very unbalanced.]

discourse structure (FS3), and finally enriched with completely unsupervised latent vector
space representation (FS4). In addition, we were gradually removing the simple features
(without lexical features, without syntactic features, etc.) to test the system with more
“abstract” feature sets (feature ablation). The results are shown in Table 9.]

[ The overall best performance (Macro-F1 = 0.251) was achieved using the rich feature
sets (01234 and 234) and significantly outperformed the baseline as well as other feature
sets. Classification of non-argumentative text (the “O” class) yields an F1 score of
about 0.7 even in the baseline setting. The boundaries of claims (Cla-B), premises
(PreB), and backing, (Bac-B) reach on average lower scores than their respective inside tags
(Cla-I, Pre-I, Bac-I). It can be interpreted such that the system is able to classify that a
certain sentence belongs to a certain argument component, but the distinction whether
it is a beginning of the argument component is harder. The very low numbers for
rebuttal and refutation have two reasons. First, these two argument components caused
many disagreements in the annotations, as discussed in Section 4.4.8, and were hard to
recognize for the humans, too. Second, these four classes have very few instances in the
corpus (about 3.4%, see Table 8), so the classifier suffers from the lack of training data.]

using only the feature set 4 (embeddings). These two domains also contain fewer

to indirectly support the claim by attacking the rebuttal, thus having a similar function
to the premise.

produced by the best-performing system to identify which phenomena pose the biggest
challenges. Properly detecting boundaries of argument components caused problems,
as shown in Figure 9(a). This is in line with the granularity annotation difficulties

fails. The example also shows that in some cases, labeling on clause level is required
(left-hand side claim and premise) but the approximation in the system cannot cope with
this level of detail (as explained in Section 5.1.1). Confusing non-argumentative text
and argument components by the system is sometimes plausible, as is the case of the
last rhetorical question in Figure 9(c). On the other hand, the last example in Figure 9(d)
shows that some claims using figurative language were difficult to identify. The
complete predictions along with the gold data are publicly available.38
Hyper-parameter Tuning. SVMhmm offers many hyper-parameters with suggested default
values, of which three are of importance. Parameter t sets the order of dependencies of
transitions in HMM, parameter e sets the order of dependencies of emissions in HMM,
and parameter c represents a trading-off slack versus magnitude of the weight-vector.39
For all experiments, we set all the hyper-parameters to their default values (t = 1, e = 0,
c = 5:0). Using the best performing feature set from Table 9, we experimented with a
grid search over different values (c 2 f0:1, 1:0, 5:0, 10:0, 50:0g, e 2 f0, 1g, t 2 f1, 2, 3g) but
the results did not outperform the system trained with default parameter values.
5.1.7 Discussion. The F1 scores might seem very low at first glance. One obvious reason
is the actual performance of the system, which gives plenty of room for improvement in
the future.40 But the main cause of low F1 numbers is the evaluation measure—using
11 classes on the token level is very strict, as it penalizes a mismatch in argument
component boundaries the same way as a wrongly predicted argument component
type. Therefore we also report two other evaluation metrics that help to put our results
into context.]

Heading

   begin: 39565
   end: 39581
[ Let us begin with summarizing answers to the research questions stated in the
Introduction. First, as we showed in Section 4.4.2, existing argumentation theories do offer
models for capturing argumentation in user-generated content on the Web. We built
upon the Toulmin model and proposed some extensions.]
Paragraph
   sofa: _InitialView
   begin: 39581
   end: 39887
[ Second, as compared to the negative experiences with annotating using Walton’s
schemes (see Sections 4.4.1 and 3.1), our modified Toulmin model offers a trade-off
between its expressiveness and annotation reliability. However, we found that the
capabilities of the model to capture argumentation depend on the register and topic,
the length of the document, and inherently on the literary devices and structures
used for expressing argumentation as these properties influence the agreement among
annotators.]
Paragraph
   sofa: _InitialView
   begin: 39887
   end: 40395
[ Third, there are aspects of online argumentation that lack their established
theoretical counterparts, such as rhetorical questions, figurative language, narratives, and
fallacies in general. We tried to model some of them in the pathos dimension of
argument (Section 4.4.10), but no satisfying agreement was reached. Furthermore, we
dealt with a step that precedes argument analysis by filtering documents, given their
persuasiveness with respect to the controversy. Finally, we proposed a computational
model based on machine learning for identifying argument components (Section 5.1). In
this identification task, we experimented with a wide range of linguistically motivated
features and found that (1) the largest feature set (including n-grams, structural features,
syntactic features, topic distribution, sentiment distribution, semantic features,
coreference feaures, discourse features, and features based on word embeddings) performs
best both in in-domain and all-data cross validation, whereas (2) features based only on
word embeddings yield best results in cross-domain evaluation.]
Paragraph
   sofa: _InitialView
   begin: 40395
   end: 41491
[ Because there is no one-size-fits-all argumentation theory to be applied to actual
data on the Web, the argumentation model and an annotation scheme for argumentation
mining is a function of the task requirements and the corpus properties. Its selection
should be based on the data at hand and the desired application. Given the proposed
use-case scenarios (Section 1) and the results of our annotation study (Section 4.4),
we recommend a scheme based on the Toulmin model for short documents, such as
comments or forum posts.]

[ Summary of Contributions. In this article we presented our original research of
argumentation mining in the user-generated Web discourse by collecting data in six controversial
topics in education. We conducted an annotation study on 990 documents to filter
persuasive comments and forum posts with inter-annotator agreement of Fleiss’ = 0:59.
Then we annotated 340 documents (approx. 90k tokens) on the token level with a
modified Toulmin model and reached inter-annotator agreement of 0.48 (Krippendorff’s
joint U). We proposed a sequence labeling approach to identify argument components
in the discourse and significantly (p< 0:001) outperformed the baseline (0.156) with
overall Macro-F1 = 0.251. We also found that a feature set based on word embeddings
works well in a cross-domain scenario and reaches Macro-F1 = 0.209. We thoroughly
examined errors made by the system and proposed future improvements.]

4.1, we compiled the raw corpus semi-automatically. Web sites with relevant comments
to articles and discussion forums were identified manually (Google search engine) in
order to maximize their relatedness to the search topic. We did not prefer any particular
platform or data source. We extracted the texts automatically, however, we did some
minimal data pre-selection and cleaning. If article comments formed a tree structure,
we kept only the root comments, as they most likely comment on the topic of the article,
